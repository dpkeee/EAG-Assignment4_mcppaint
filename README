# MCP Client-Server Project

This project implements a client-server architecture using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides various mathematical operations and integrates with Microsoft Paint to perform drawing tasks and add text. The project also includes functionality to send emails.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- **Drawing in Paint**: Automate drawing shapes (like rectangles) in Microsoft Paint using mouse movements.
- **Text Addition**: Add text to the Paint canvas at specified coordinates.
- **Email Sending**: Send emails using SMTP with configurable settings.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dpkeee/EAG-Assignment4_mcppaint.git
   cd EAG-Assignment4_mcppaint
   ```

2. Install the required packages. You can use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure you have the following packages installed:
   - `mcp`
   - `Pillow`
   - `pywinauto`
   - `pyautogui`
   - `smtplib`
   - `win32api`
   - `win32gui`
   - `win32con`

## Usage

1. **Start the MCP Server**: Client itself will start the server,, so just run talk2mcp.py


   ```bash
   python talk2mcp.py
   ```

2. **Open Microsoft Paint**: Use the `open_paint` function to launch Paint.

   ```python
   await open_paint()
   ```

3. **Draw a Rectangle**: Call the `draw_rectangle` function with the desired coordinates.

   ```python
   await draw_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
   ```

4. **Add Text**: Use the `add_text_in_paint` function to add text to the canvas.

   ```python
   await add_text_in_paint("Your text here")
   ```

5. **Perform Calculations**: Use the provided mathematical functions to perform calculations.

   ```python
   result = add(5, 3)  # Example of addition
   ```

6. **Send an Email**: Use the `send_email` function to send an email.

   ```python
   send_email(to="recipient@example.com", subject="Subject", body="Email body")
   ```
